(Unofficial) Implementation of the paper "Cross-View Tracking for Multi-Human 3D Pose Estimation at over 100 FPS" Chen et al.

## Disclaimer: 
1. The repo is currently unlicensed as the license information is unclear to me in the [original repo](https://github.com/longcw/crossview_3d_pose_tracking/tree/master). I will update this repo when that becomes clear.
2. The code runs below 100 FPS as it is severely unoptimized now. This code was meant to quickly implement the paper to the best of my ability. 
3. Thanks to the author of the original repo for making the visualization and calibration code available. The graph partitioning problem solver was also provided by the author [here](https://gist.github.com/longcw/654a86ffe11122079040a7615c99a627#file-bip_solver-py-L9). Kudos.
4. My work in this repo is limited to combining all the available pieces and implementing the algo. Again thanks to the authors for their awesome work.
